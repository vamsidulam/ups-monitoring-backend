## 🔍 **Detailed Failure Analysis Example**

**UPS002 (Critical Issues):**
```
🚨 HIGH BATTERY FAILURE RISK: Battery level at 29.03% shows critical wear. 
   The UPS may fail to sustain load during power interruptions, risking data 
   loss and equipment damage. Schedule emergency battery replacement.

ℹ️ ELEVATED TEMPERATURE RISK: Temperature at 41.72°C is above optimal range. 
   This accelerates component aging and increases failure probability during 
   peak loads. Monitor cooling efficiency and ensure proper ventilation.

🚨 CRITICAL POWER IMBALANCE: Power imbalance of 363.51W indicates severe 
   electrical problems. The UPS is not properly regulating power flow, which 
   will cause voltage fluctuations and equipment damage. This requires 
   immediate electrical inspection and repair.
